		<h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>
		<p>
		<br>
		From western Philadelphia I hail
		where in my youth I'd play upon the green
		'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd
		by ruffians contemptible and mean.<br><br>
		
		<mark class="pa">Although the spat was trivial and brief, 
		it wounded my dear mother deep within;
		and so, to give her conscience sweet relief, 
		she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.<br>
		When to my port of call I'd been conveyed, 
		I came upon a coachman most unique;
		and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,
		despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.</mark><br> <br>

		<mark class="pb">
		I survey all the land with princely mien
		in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.</mark>
